## ðŸŽ¤ YOUR 60-SECOND PITCH

> "Hi, I'm Ahmet Mikail Bayindir. ReliefSense is a full-stack humanitarian
> agriculture platform I built using React, TypeScript, and Python Flask. It
> features a real-time dashboard that monitors environmental sensors like
> temperature, humidity, and COâ‚‚, along with complete crop lifecycle management
> and data visualizations. I implemented PWA capabilities for offline
> functionality, multi-language support including right-to-left layouts for
> Arabic, and mobile-first responsive design. The biggest technical challenge
> was creating an offline-first architecture that works without reliable
> internet, which is critical for humanitarian deployments. This project
> demonstrates my full-stack development capabilities and my passion for using
> technology to solve real-world problems in humanitarian contexts. You can
> see the complete codebase and documentation at
> github.com/ahmetmikailbayindir/ReliefSense."
